MI-Brain
========

Imeka medical imaging applications based on [Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK)](https://www.mitk.org).

We removed several features from MITK and added our own plugins in order to have a practical and fast image viewer for diffusion image tailored to the needs of DMRI experts. This is a free-to-use project but all Imeka modifications are private (not open source).

The current release is based on MITK 2018.04 and has been released on 2020-04-09. We do plan to release updated versions of MI-Brain in the future. Click [here](https://github.com/imeka/mi-brain/releases) to download MI-Brain.
